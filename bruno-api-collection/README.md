## Usage Flow

### 1. Health Check (Optional)

Start by verifying the API is running:

1. **Health Check** - Basic API status
2. **Health Check Detailed** - Includes database connectivity

### 2. Authentication Flow

Run requests in this order:

1. **Register** - Create a new user account

   - Automatically saves the token to environment variable

2. **Login** - Login with existing credentials

   - Automatically saves the token to environment variable

3. **Get Profile** - Test authentication by getting user profile
   - Uses the saved token

### 3. Expense Management

After authentication, test expense operations:

1. **Create Expense** - Add a new expense

   - Automatically saves the expense ID for other requests

2. **Get All Expenses** - List all expenses with pagination

3. **Get Expenses with Filter** - Filter by category and date range

4. **Get Expense by ID** - Get a specific expense

   - Uses the saved expense ID from Create

5. **Update Expense** - Full update of an expense

6. **Partial Update Expense** - Update only specific fields

7. **Delete Expense** - Remove an expense

### 4. Dashboard Analytics

Test dashboard endpoints:

1. **Get Dashboard Summary** - Overall statistics

2. **Get Summary with Date Filter** - Filtered statistics

3. **Get Category Analytics** - Breakdown by category

4. **Get Category Analytics with Filter** - Filtered by date

5. **Get Monthly Trends** - 12-month trend data

6. **Get Monthly Trends by Year** - Specific year trends

7. **Get Recent Expenses** - Latest expenses

## Environment Variables

The collection uses these environment variables:

- `baseUrl` - The API base URL
- `token` - JWT authentication token (auto-set by auth requests)
- `expenseId` - Last created expense ID (auto-set by Create Expense)

## Tests

Each request includes automated tests that verify:

- Response status codes
- Response body structure
- Data types
- Required fields
- Business logic

Tests run automatically after each request and show pass/fail status.

## Running All Tests

To run all requests in sequence:

1. Select the collection in Bruno
2. Click the "Run Collection" button
3. Review the test results

## Tips

1. **Start with Authentication** - Always run Register or Login first to get a valid token

2. **Check Environment Variables** - Make sure `token` is set after login

3. **Create Test Data** - Run "Create Expense" a few times to generate test data

4. **Use Variables** - The `{{expenseId}}` variable is automatically set, but you can manually update it in the environment

5. **Modify Request Bodies** - Feel free to modify the JSON bodies to test different scenarios

6. **Check Tests** - Review the test results to ensure APIs work correctly

## Example Data

The collection includes realistic example data:

- **Categories**: Food, Transportation, Shopping, Entertainment, Bills, Healthcare, Other
- **Sample Expenses**: Grocery shopping, gas, rent, etc.
- **Date Ranges**: Current month and year

## Troubleshooting

### Token Not Set

- Run Login or Register request again
- Check that the response includes a token
- Verify the post-response script executed

### 401 Unauthorized

- Your token may have expired
- Run Login again to get a fresh token

### 404 Not Found

- Check that the API server is running
- Verify the baseUrl in your environment
- Ensure expense ID exists (run Create Expense first)

### Connection Error

- Verify the API server is running on the configured port
- Check your baseUrl environment variable
- Ensure no firewall blocking the connection

### Database Connection Error (Health Check)

- Ensure PostgreSQL is running
- Check database credentials in backend `.env`
- Verify Prisma migrations are applied

## Contributing

When adding new endpoints:

1. Create a new `.bru` file in the appropriate folder
2. Include proper metadata and tests
3. Use environment variables for dynamic values
4. Add documentation in this README
5. Commit the changes to Git

## Version Control

All `.bru` files are plain text and Git-friendly. Commit them like any other code file:

```bash
git add bruno-api-collection/
git commit -m "Add/Update API collection"
git push
```
